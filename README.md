# CyberRoutien

- Cyber ​​Routine is a small project born out of my fanaticism for the Cyberpunk Edgerunners series. This app is inspired by it and uses its entire essence to maximize your productivity with a task-based app. Eurodollars can be exchanged for "Biochips," which are nothing more than app upgrades, while points let you know how productive you are.
